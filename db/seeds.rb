# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)

# product = Product.find_or_initialize_by(title: "Rails Scales!")

# <em>Practical Techniques for Performance and Growth</em>
# Rails doesn’t scale. So say the naysayers. They’re wrong. Ruby on Rails
# runs some of the biggest sites in the world, impacting the lives of
# millions of users while efficiently crunching petabytes of data. This
# book reveals how they do it, and how you can apply the same techniques to
# your applications. Optimize everything necessary to make an application
# function at scale: monitoring, product design, Ruby code, software
# architecture, database access, caching, and more. Even if your app may
# never have millions of users, you reduce the costs of hosting and
# maintaining it.

# unless product.image.attached?
#   product.image.attach(
#     io: File.open(Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/rails.png")),
#     filename: "rails.png",
#     content_type: "image/png"
#   )
# end
# product.save!
